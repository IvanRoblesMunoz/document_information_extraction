Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",

Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on.

Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",

Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",

They have also produced a range of cookery books published to accompany their various television series.\n",

Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",

Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",

      "David Myers (born 8 September 1957) and Si King (born 20 October 1966) collectively known as the Hairy Bikers, are British television chefs. They have presented a range of television shows that combine cooking with the travelogue format, mostly for the BBC but also for the now-defunct Good Food channel. They have also produced a range of cookery books published to accompany their various television series.\n",
      "Myers and King have known each other since the 1990s, with both having backgrounds in television production. Their first appearance on UK television was as presenters of The Hairy Bikers Cookbook, which began on the BBC in 2004 and continued for four series.\n",

Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",
      "Incubation is not designed for creating or developing new articles outside of mainspace—that role is taken by WP:Articles for Creation. Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",

      "David Myers (born 8 September 1957) and Si King (born 20 October 1966) collectively known as the Hairy Bikers, are British television chefs. They have presented a range of television shows that combine cooking with the travelogue format, mostly for the BBC but also for the now-defunct Good Food channel. They have also produced a range of cookery books published to accompany their various television series.\n",
      "Myers and King have known each other since the 1990s, with both having backgrounds in television production. Their first appearance on UK television was as presenters of The Hairy Bikers Cookbook, which began on the BBC in 2004 and continued for four series.\n",

      "The article incubator is a place for holding articles that do not meet Wikipedias content criteria (WP:NOT, WP:N, WP:OR, WP:NPOV, WP:BLP, and WP:V), but a rationale has been put forward that the article meets the incubation criteria, which means there is an intention that the article can and will be improved. Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",
      "Incubation is not designed for creating or developing new articles outside of mainspace—that role is taken by WP:Articles for Creation. Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",

      "The article incubator is a place for holding articles that do not meet Wikipedias content criteria (WP:NOT, WP:N, WP:OR, WP:NPOV, WP:BLP, and WP:V), but a rationale has been put forward that the article meets the incubation criteria, which means there is an intention that the article can and will be improved. Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",
      "Incubation is not designed for creating or developing new articles outside of mainspace—that role is taken by WP:Articles for Creation. Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",

Incubation is intended to be a more centralized alternative to WP:Userfication. Articles in incubation are in limbo—they have been deleted from article namespace, but are still part of Wikipedia, awaiting a decision to be moved back into the article namespace (mainspace), or be deleted completely from all Wikipedia namespace.\n",

Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",

      "Incubation is not designed for creating or developing new articles outside of mainspace—that role is taken by WP:Articles for Creation. Nor is it designed as a buffer zone between nomination for deletion and a deletion decision—that role is taken by Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron. Incubation is a soft deletion process whereby problematic articles are removed from mainspace but remain accessible by non-admins so they can be worked on. Incubated articles are automatically noindexed, meaning they wont show up in search engines.\n",
      "Articles enter the incubator via 2 main paths:\n",
      "From a deletion process such as AfD, MfD, PROD or Speedy, in which a decision is made to incubate rather than delete or keep\n",
      "From userspace, when a previously deleted article has been userfied,\n",
      "Incubation is for material or articles that have already been through the deletion process and it has been decided that while, at the time of the decision, the material did not meet our inclusion criteria, there was justifiable reason to believe the material/article could be made to meet the inclusion criteria given enough time; sometimes articles that have been deleted are userfied (moved into userspace), and these articles may be worked on in userspace and then brought to the incubator for assistance in moving back into mainspace—but articles that originated in userspace and have never been through the deletion process may be moved directly into mainspace and so are not appropriate for the incubation process.\n",
      "There is no guarantee that incubated articles will be moved back into the Wikipedia mainspace.\n",
      "As a rule, an article should not be moved to incubation unless it meets the incubator criteria, which means there is an intention that the article can and will be improved. Content intended for mainspace should not be kept indefinitely on subpages, per the Wikipedia guideline regarding the third disallowed use of subpages. Pages in the incubator may be nominated for deletion through Wikipedia:Miscellany for Deletion after a reasonable time has been allowed for development. What is reasonable will vary depending on circumstances\n",

Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n",

The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.\n",
      "The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers golden age. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n",
      "During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the Crac housed a company of müstahfızan (equivalent to local janissaries) and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hısnülekrad, attached first to the sancak (province) of Tripoli and later Homs. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area and in the eighteenth century the district was mainly controlled by the Dandashli family of local notables. In 1894 the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of redif (auxiliary) soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result the capital of the district was then moved to Tall Kalakh.\n",
      "Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\n",

      "west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qalat Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun.

Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n",

      "Krak des Chevaliers or Crac des Chevaliers (; ), also called Ḥiṣn al-Akrād (, literally\n",
      "Fortress of the Kurds) and formerly Crac de lOspital, is a Crusader castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.\n",
      "The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers golden age. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n",
      "During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the Crac housed a company of müstahfızan (equivalent to local janissaries) and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hısnülekrad, attached first to the sancak (province) of Tripoli and later Homs. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area and in the eighteenth century the district was mainly controlled by the Dandashli family of local notables. In 1894 the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of redif (auxiliary) soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result the capital of the district was then moved to Tall Kalakh.\n",
      "Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\n",
      "Today, a village called al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately\n",
      "west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qalat Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.\n"

      "Krak des Chevaliers or Crac des Chevaliers (; ), also called Ḥiṣn al-Akrād (, literally\n",
      "Fortress of the Kurds) and formerly Crac de lOspital, is a Crusader castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.\n",
      "The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers golden age. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n",
      "During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the Crac housed a company of müstahfızan (equivalent to local janissaries) and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hısnülekrad, attached first to the sancak (province) of Tripoli and later Homs. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area and in the eighteenth century the district was mainly controlled by the Dandashli family of local notables. In 1894 the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of redif (auxiliary) soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result the capital of the district was then moved to Tall Kalakh.\n",
      "Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\n",
      "Today, a village called al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately\n",
      "west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qalat Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.\n"

It is part of the municipality of Saint-Antoine-de-lIsle-aux-Grues, located in the Chaudière-Appalaches region of the province.\n",
      "Also known as Grosse Isle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site, the island was the site of an immigration depot which predominantly housed Irish immigrants coming to Canada to escape the Great Famine of 1845–1849. In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-19th century to accommodate Irish immigrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n",
      "It is believed that over 3,000 Irish people died on the island and that over 5,000 are currently buried in the cemetery there; many died en route. Most who died on the island were infected with typhus, a result of poor sanitary conditions there in 1847. Grosse Isle is the largest burial ground for refugees of the Great Famine outside Ireland. After the Canadian Confederation in 1867, the buildings and equipment were modernized to meet the standards of the new Canadian governments immigration policies.\n",
      "Grosse Isle is sometimes called Canadas Ellis Island (1892–1954), an association it shares with the Pier 21 immigration facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is estimated that in total, from its opening in 1832 to its closing in 1932, almost 500,000 Irish immigrants passed through Grosse Isle on their way to Canada.\n",

In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-19th century to accommodate Irish immigrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n",

      "Fortress of the Kurds) and formerly Crac de lOspital, is a Crusader castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.\n",
      "The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers golden age. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n",
      "During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the Crac housed a company of müstahfızan (equivalent to local janissaries) and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hısnülekrad, attached first to the sancak (province) of Tripoli and later Homs. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area and in the eighteenth century the district was mainly controlled by the Dandashli family of local notables. In 1894 the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of redif (auxiliary) soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result the capital of the district was then moved to Tall Kalakh.\n",
      "Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\n",
      "Today, a village called al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is approximately\n",
      "west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qalat Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.\n"

It is part of the municipality of Saint-Antoine-de-lIsle-aux-Grues, located in the Chaudière-Appalaches region of the province.\n",
      "Also known as Grosse Isle and the Irish Memorial National Historic Site, the island was the site of an immigration depot which predominantly housed Irish immigrants coming to Canada to escape the Great Famine of 1845–1849. In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-19th century to accommodate Irish immigrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n",
      "It is believed that over 3,000 Irish people died on the island and that over 5,000 are currently buried in the cemetery there; many died en route. Most who died on the island were infected with typhus, a result of poor sanitary conditions there in 1847. Grosse Isle is the largest burial ground for refugees of the Great Famine outside Ireland. After the Canadian Confederation in 1867, the buildings and equipment were modernized to meet the standards of the new Canadian governments immigration policies.\n",
      "Grosse Isle is sometimes called Canadas Ellis Island (1892–1954), an association it shares with the Pier 21 immigration facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It is estimated that in total, from its opening in 1832 to its closing in 1932, almost 500,000 Irish immigrants passed through Grosse Isle on their way to Canada.\n",

      "Fortress of the Kurds) and formerly Crac de lOspital, is a Crusader castle in Syria and one of the most important preserved medieval castles in the world. The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.\n",
      "The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers golden age. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n",

In 1832, the Lower Canadian Government had previously set up this depot to contain an earlier cholera epidemic that was believed to be caused by the large influx of European immigrants, and the station was reopened in the mid-19th century to accommodate Irish immigrants who had contracted typhus during their voyages. Thousands of Irish were quarantined on Grosse Isle from 1832 to 1848.\n",

The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the order of the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271.\n",
      "The Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers golden age. At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n",
      "During the Ottoman period (1516–1918), the Crac housed a company of müstahfızan (equivalent to local janissaries) and was the centre of the nahiye (tax district) of Hısnülekrad, attached first to the sancak (province) of Tripoli and later Homs. The castle itself was commanded by a dizdar (castle warden). Several Turkmen and Kurdish tribes were settled in the area and in the eighteenth century the district was mainly controlled by the Dandashli family of local notables. In 1894 the Ottoman government considered stationing a company of redif (auxiliary) soldiers there, but revised its plans after deciding the castle was too old and access too difficult. As a result the capital of the district was then moved to Tall Kalakh.\n",
      "Renewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French Alawite State, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control.\n",

Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qalat Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun.

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",

      "Red kite, often considered to be the national bird of Wales.\n",
      "This list of birds of Wales includes every species of bird that has been recorded in a wild state in Wales. Compared to the avifauna of Britain as a whole, Wales has fewer breeding species, but these include a number of moorland species such as red grouse and black grouse, large numbers of seabirds (particularly on offshore islands such as Skomer, Grassholm and Bardsey) and good populations of several species typical of Welsh oak woods including redstart, pied flycatcher and wood warbler. Among the birds of prey is the red kite, which had become extinct in other parts of Britain until being reintroduced recently. In winter many wildfowl and waders are found around the coast, attracted by the mild temperatures. In spring and autumn a variety of migrant and vagrant birds can be seen, particularly on headlands and islands. Three-quarters of the UK population of the red-billed chough resides in Wales.\n",
      "The list is based on Birds in Wales (Lovegrove et al. 1994), Birds in Wales 1992–2000 (Green 2002) and the list of the Welsh Ornithological Society (Prater & Thorpe 2006) with updates from the Welsh Records Panels annual reports. The taxonomy and scientific names follow the official list of the British Ornithologists Union (BOU). The English names are the vernacular names used in the 7th edition of the BOU list with the standardized names from that list given in brackets where they differ. The family introductions are based on The New Encyclopedia of Birds (Perrins 2004) except where otherwise stated. The number of species in each family is approximate due to differing opinions on classification; the numbers given in the list are based on The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 6th edition.\n",
      "Certain categories of birds are noted with the following tags:\n",
      "BR\n",
      "British rarity – a species which occurs only as a rare visitor to Great Britain with fewer than 100 records in the last 10 years or less than 200 records ever. Records of these species are adjudicated by the British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC).\n",
      "WR\n",
      "Welsh rarity – a species which occurs, on average, 5 times or less each year in Wales and is not considered by the BBRC. Records of these species are adjudicated by the Welsh Records Panel of the Welsh Ornithological Society.\n",
      "I\n",
      "Introduced – a non-native species whose presence in Wales is a result of accidental or deliberate release of birds into the wild by humans. They have either formed an established, self-sustaining breeding population in the country or have wandered from established populations in England.\n",
      "The total number of species on the list is 435 including 133 British rarities, 65 Welsh rarities and 10 introduced species. About 150 species breed annually.\n",
